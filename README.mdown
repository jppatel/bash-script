# About This Scripts #
I created this script for my personal use, but I think it will help others too.

## How to run? ##
You can run this scripts through **bash \<scriptname\>.sh** from you console.

## About deleteoldfiles.sh ##

The script will help you to delete old files from your directory. Make sure you placed script under appropriate directory from where you want to delete files.
PS: Please update **$DIR** and **-mmin** value [current value is 540 minute] as per you requirements.

## About mediasync.sh ##

I used this script to backup my Magento project **media** directory and I think it's not limited to Magento media directory. You can change the path it will take your files to your storage path.

## About securefiles.sh ##

Again, I used this script to set **immutable** flag to my Magento project file system. Offcourse I don't want anyone to edit my project files.

Feel free to edit *Use it as you see fit* or found any issues/bug.
